# Personal finance webapp cs50 final project

The project is a webapp based on Django framework with Python. Check it out
here: https://youtu.be/hpU8AA_TSL0 . I will make it available on www.cosmincristescu.com as soon as possible.
This webapp is called 'Personal finance' and it helps users by keeping track of their incomes and
expenses. In the mainpage there are two forms used for sending the income and expenses data to
the server and also three boxes where we find the total amount of spendings, income and the
balance. The user is able to change the curency, the password and also to see inputted data. For
almost 3 years I used an Excel for my personal finances so I linked this webapp with Google's API's.
Whenever I introduce data to the webapp, it sends it automatically to the Excel spreadsheet.
